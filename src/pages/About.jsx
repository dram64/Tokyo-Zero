        <h3>About Tokyo Zero</h3>
        <h2>Bridging the gap between artist and consumer</h2>
        <p>
          Tokyo Zero stemmed from my love of anime, gaming, art, designing and
          commerce.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a frequent congoer and pop up events in California, I have fallen
          in with the art of Asian-based pop culture. So much so that I wanted
          to do more than just buy them. I wanted to create new ideas and work
          with artists to sell amazing pieces of work, as a way to put my skills
          to use and give back to the community by providing appealing artwork.
          I founded Tokyo Zero as a way to bridge the gap between some of my
          favorite artists based in Asia and the American consumer, while at the
          same time supporting these artists. Being someone who is up to date on
          the latest trends in Asian pop culture, yet lives in the USA, I found
          myself and many people missing out on a lot of stunning artworks and
          products from artists across the globe. This is why I want to at least
          try to bring some of that here to the U.S consumer. I commission and I
          work closely and collaboratively with these artists to produce unique
          designs that showcase their talents. This is only a portion of what I
          do, as I also contact Chinese suppliers for most of my products to
          order products and ensure quality control. While I do not draw these
          artworks myself, I do create the graphic designs when it comes to the
          website and products and go to local events to sell these products.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also use this brand to fuse my hobbies and technical work skills
          into one, as I also have a great interest in Photography, UI/UX
          design, Web Development, and Graphic Design.
